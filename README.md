# Example

This repository is an example of how to add the most permissive licensing to your repository in a short but explanatory manner.

It is an attempt to SAVE TIME for you, the users of your code, the legal staff that the users work with, the employer of those users, etc.

Note that this example proposes two things:
1. use a 0BSD license [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/SymboLinker/licensing-example/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) without the year component.
2. use the following part in your readme to explain a few things and to spread the message that there are "equivalent licenses" 
that are all acceptable variants of the same thing.

## License

This repository uses the most permissive licensing available. The "BSD Zero Clause License" ([0BSD](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/)) allows for<br/>
commercial + non-commercial use, closed + open source, with + without modifications, etc. and [is equivalent](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/805) to licenses like:

- "MIT No Attribution License" ([MIT-0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit-0//)).
- "The Unlicense" ([Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)).
- "CC0" ([CC0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0/)).

The "BSD Zero Clause License" ([0BSD](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/)) does not have the condition

> (...), provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.

which is part of the "MIT License" ([MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) and its shorter equivalent "ISC License" ([ISC](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/)). Apart from that they are all equivalent.
